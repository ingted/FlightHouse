            <para>
            This extension provides sharding functionality of actors in a cluster.
            The typical use case is when you have many stateful actors that together consume
            more resources (e.g. memory) than fit on one machine. You need to distribute them across
            several nodes in the cluster and you want to be able to interact with them using their
            logical identifier, but without having to care about their physical location in the cluster,
            which might also change over time. It could for example be actors representing Aggregate Roots in
            Domain-Driven Design terminology. Here we call these actors "entities". These actors
            typically have persistent (durable) state, but this feature is not limited to
            actors with persistent state.
            </para>
            <para>
            In this context sharding means that actors with an identifier, so called entities,
            can be automatically distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster. Each entity
            actor runs only at one place, and messages can be sent to the entity without requiring
            the sender to know the location of the destination actor. This is achieved by sending
            the messages via a <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actor provided by this extension, which knows how
            to route the message with the entity id to the final destination.
            </para>
            <para>
            This extension is supposed to be used by first, typically at system startup on each node
            in the cluster, registering the supported entity types with the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterShardingGuardian.Start"/>
            method and then the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actor for a named entity type can be retrieved with
            <see cref="M:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ClusterSharding.ShardRegion(System.String)"/>. Messages to the entities are always sent via the local
            <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/>. Some settings can be configured as described in the `akka.contrib.cluster.sharding`
            section of the `reference.conf`.
            </para>
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actor is started on each node in the cluster, or group of nodes
            tagged with a specific role. The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> is created with two application specific
            functions to extract the entity identifier and the shard identifier from incoming messages.
            A shard is a group of entities that will be managed together. For the first message in a
            specific shard the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> request the location of the shard from a central coordinator,
            the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/>. The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/> decides which <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> that
            owns the shard. The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> receives the decided home of the shard
            and if that is the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> instance itself it will create a local child
            actor representing the entity and direct all messages for that entity to it.
            If the shard home is another <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> instance messages will be forwarded
            to that <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> instance instead. While resolving the location of a
            shard incoming messages for that shard are buffered and later delivered when the
            shard home is known. Subsequent messages to the resolved shard can be delivered
            to the target destination immediately without involving the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            To make sure that at most one instance of a specific entity actor is running somewhere
            in the cluster it is important that all nodes have the same view of where the shards
            are located. Therefore the shard allocation decisions are taken by the central
            <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/>, which is running as a cluster singleton, i.e. one instance on
            the oldest member among all cluster nodes or a group of nodes tagged with a specific
            role. The oldest member can be determined by <see cref="M:Akka.Cluster.Member.IsOlderThan(Akka.Cluster.Member)"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            The logic that decides where a shard is to be located is defined in a pluggable shard
            allocation strategy. The default implementation <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.LeastShardAllocationStrategy"/>
            allocates new shards to the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> with least number of previously allocated shards.
            This strategy can be replaced by an application specific implementation.
            </para>
            <para>
            To be able to use newly added members in the cluster the coordinator facilitates rebalancing
            of shards, i.e. migrate entities from one node to another. In the rebalance process the
            coordinator first notifies all <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actors that a handoff for a shard has started.
            That means they will start buffering incoming messages for that shard, in the same way as if the
            shard location is unknown. During the rebalance process the coordinator will not answer any
            requests for the location of shards that are being rebalanced, i.e. local buffering will
            continue until the handoff is completed. The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> responsible for the rebalanced shard
            will stop all entities in that shard by sending `PoisonPill` to them. When all entities have
            been terminated the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> owning the entities will acknowledge the handoff as completed
            to the coordinator. Thereafter the coordinator will reply to requests for the location of
            the shard and thereby allocate a new home for the shard and then buffered messages in the
            <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actors are delivered to the new location. This means that the state of the entities
            are not transferred or migrated. If the state of the entities are of importance it should be
            persistent (durable), e.g. with `Akka.Persistence`, so that it can be recovered at the new
            location.
            </para>
            <para>
            The logic that decides which shards to rebalance is defined in a pluggable shard
            allocation strategy. The default implementation <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.LeastShardAllocationStrategy"/>
            picks shards for handoff from the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> with most number of previously allocated shards.
            They will then be allocated to the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> with least number of previously allocated shards,
            i.e. new members in the cluster. There is a configurable threshold of how large the difference
            must be to begin the rebalancing. This strategy can be replaced by an application specific
            implementation.
            </para>
            <para>
            The state of shard locations in the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/> is persistent (durable) with
            `Akka.Persistence` to survive failures. Since it is running in a cluster `Akka.Persistence`
            must be configured with a distributed journal. When a crashed or unreachable coordinator
            node has been removed (via down) from the cluster a new <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/> singleton
            actor will take over and the state is recovered. During such a failure period shards
            with known location are still available, while messages for new (unknown) shards
            are buffered until the new <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.PersistentShardCoordinator"/> becomes available.
            </para>
            <para>
            As long as a sender uses the same <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actor to deliver messages to an entity
            actor the order of the messages is preserved. As long as the buffer limit is not reached
            messages are delivered on a best effort basis, with at-most once delivery semantics,
            in the same way as ordinary message sending. Reliable end-to-end messaging, with
            at-least-once semantics can be added by using <see cref="T:Akka.Persistence.AtLeastOnceDeliveryActor"/> in `Akka.Persistence`.
            </para>
            Some additional latency is introduced for messages targeted to new or previously
            unused shards due to the round-trip to the coordinator. Rebalancing of shards may
            also add latency. This should be considered when designing the application specific
            shard resolution, e.g. to avoid too fine grained shards.
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> actor can also be started in proxy only mode, i.e. it will not
            host any entities itself, but knows how to delegate messages to the right location.
            A <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/> starts in proxy only mode if the roles of the node does not include
            the node role specified in `akka.contrib.cluster.sharding.role` config property
            or if the specified `EntityProps` is <see langword="null"/>.
            </para>
            <para>
            If the state of the entities are persistent you may stop entities that are not used to
            reduce memory consumption. This is done by the application specific implementation of
            the entity actors for example by defining receive timeout (<see cref="M:Akka.Actor.IActorContext.SetReceiveTimeout(System.Nullable{System.TimeSpan})"/>).
            If a message is already enqueued to the entity when it stops itself the enqueued message
            in the mailbox will be dropped. To support graceful passivation without loosing such
            messages the entity actor can send <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate"/> to its parent <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/>.
            The specified wrapped message in <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate"/> will be sent back to the entity, which is
            then supposed to stop itself. Incoming messages will be buffered by the <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/>
            between reception of <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate"/> and termination of the entity. Such buffered messages
            are thereafter delivered to a new incarnation of the entity.

             A `rebalanceThreshold` of 1 gives the best distribution and therefore typically the best choice.
             A higher threshold means that more shards can be rebalanced at the same time instead of one-by-one.
             That has the advantage that the rebalance process can be quicker but has the drawback that the
             the number of shards (and therefore load) between different nodes may be significantly different.
             Given the recommendation of using 10x shards than number of nodes and `rebalanceThreshold=10` can result
             in one node hosting ~2 times the number of shards of other nodes.Example: 1000 shards on 100 nodes means
             10 shards per node.One node may have 19 shards and others 10 without a rebalance occurring.
            
             The number of ongoing rebalancing processes can be limited by `maxSimultaneousRebalance`.

            If the state of the entries are persistent you may stop entries that are not used to
            reduce memory consumption. This is done by the application specific implementation of
            the entity actors for example by defining receive timeout (<see cref="M:Akka.Actor.IActorContext.SetReceiveTimeout(System.Nullable{System.TimeSpan})"/>).
            If a message is already enqueued to the entity when it stops itself the enqueued message
            in the mailbox will be dropped. To support graceful passivation without loosing such
            messages the entity actor can send this <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate"/> message to its parent <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.ShardRegion"/>.
            The specified wrapped <see cref="P:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate.StopMessage"/> will be sent back to the entity, which is
            then supposed to stop itself. Incoming messages will be buffered by the `ShardRegion`
            between reception of <see cref="T:Akka.Cluster.Sharding.Passivate"/> and termination of the entity. Such buffered messages
            are thereafter delivered to a new incarnation of the entity.

            Sends stopMessage (e.g. `PoisonPill`) to the entities and when all of
             them have terminated it replies with `ShardStopped`.
             If the entities don't terminate after `handoffTimeout` it will try stopping them forcefully.
